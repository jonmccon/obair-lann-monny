Providence & Swedish
Making healthcare a little easier

My time with Providence Health & Services' Digital Innovation Group focused on two distinct digital product categories. First, designing an on-demand emergency room video call platform with remote diagnostic instruments. After partnering with Sunny Lee & Kelly Elston to research Providence's established caregiver process, protocol, and hardware we designed and tested service workflows and case management tools.  Secondly, a quartet of established care services were rearchitected as a suite of Express Care options and brought together on a shared marketing & scheduling platform with a multitenant architecture.

I also helped develop a visual language for the suite of provider & patient healthcare tools. A team process of leveraging Abstract (git), Sketch (layout), Invision (public prototyping), Zeplin (internal prototyping), along with the Adobe Creative Cloud (production). The visual design system was based on Google's Material language, but out of the box it felt too cold for the healthcare world. After partnering with engineering, we developed a solution of taking React Toolbox and subbing in a humanistic typeface, rounded some corners and generally opened up the vanilla styles (more padding). By working with these tools, we were able to more fluently migrate interaction & visual work into React components via direct collaboration in Storybook.
