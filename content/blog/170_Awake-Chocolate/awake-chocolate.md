Digital cartography platforms are notably difficult to theme visually due to the quantity of information presented and how itâ€™s rendered. I asked myself just how far could I push Google Maps with a simple JSON styling tool and GPS locationing. Honestly that led to me pushing myself to the brink of copy & paste insanity when I needed to geocode all the gas stations across greater Ontario that carried these.
