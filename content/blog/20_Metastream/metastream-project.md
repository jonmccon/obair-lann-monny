Strengthening our spatial citizenship
A minimap for good locales

Metastream sought to engage with the cohabitants of Seattle through an augmented reflection our environmental timeline. A map to see and understand surrounding realtime data and accessible only by being near a physical locale.

Metastream sought to engage with the cohabitants of Seattle through an augmented reflection our environmental timeline. A map to see and understand surrounding realtime data and accessible only by being near a physical locale.

In collaboration with cofounder Mike Shrieve, a study that leveraged (and required us to learn) progressive web apps, Mapbox, Firebase, Google Cloud platform, and Gitlab. In collaboration with the Open Streetmap community and public data from the City of Seattle.
