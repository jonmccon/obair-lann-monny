Shutterstock wanted the Seattle AIGA chapter to host one of its first battles in the Pixels of Fury championship and I was able to play ringmaster at the lovely Makers Space for a night.

Fueled by pizza, cupcakes and Hilliards, six local designers duked it out in front of creative directors from Tether and Digital Kitchen in three rounds of 20 minute poster battles announced by Terry Marks. I built my own 3D cardboard & hot glue adaptation of the newly announced Adobe CC logo to have it disassembled in a festive mere seconds after announcing the final winner. Luckily we had a proper crystal trophy, just in case.
