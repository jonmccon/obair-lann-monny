As a member of the Digital Devices Group, I helped migrate the release of Android P into Amazonâ€™s Kindle tablet os. Developed ux adaptations & updated visual treatments of existing and net new system level features including the architecture of the home app launcher, content organization & recommendations, search results, top toggle, status alerts, and dark theme treatments.

Along with balancing the performance on a different hardware spec and different appstore architecture of the Amazon product ecosystem.
