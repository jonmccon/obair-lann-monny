Content & performance analysis

The summer of 2021 was all about boiling down disparate data points into storytelling elements. As the sole designer for [Resonance AI](https://www.resonanceai.com/) I was able to reorient the brand & product to be an opinionated feedback platform for video & TV production clients. Two fonts were chosen to provide a distinction between hard data and analysis, as well as exploring color pallettes that created understandable distinction of an desired outcome. Taking these visual standards and combining multiple datapoints in novel ways, I created charting systems that individually represented a section of episode performance but that could be read together overall due to the shared design system.

Once we had an understanding of how we wanted the charting to work, I prototyped them in Plotly / vanilla js with mock data and migrated them to Plotly / Jupyter before handing it off to the engineering team.

Platform redesign for a machine learning video feedback platform. Initially the data from the ML scientists was being represented as individual data points and the product & marketing teams needed to decipher and present the story of their work to customers. I approached the work as a rebranding of the company and revamping of how the proprietary data is presented. 

In collaboration with Dan Wiegand, I helped build data visualizations that were emailed daily & weekly to customers consolidating their showâ€™s performance. After automating this previously manual task, our work focused on building an episode analyzer so that a customer could dig in to the details of who & what was on screen at a given moment and corroborated this data against audience attendance.
