[] rewrite that subtitle

[] change to mopop

I produced the first & second annual official Decibel Festival Popup Artshows featuring over 40 local poster designers. Maybe it's just a part of a proper show opening to the public, but unfortunately you really had to be there for these.

The 2013 centennial show called upon the talents of Benajmin Van Citters, Nick Bartoletti, Chris Blohm and Patrick Wright to projection map and augment the whole show (from window displays, to rotating poster frames, to dancing skeleton tracking via Kinnect). A monday night quadruple kegger later, it was the highest attended opening event in the festival's history.

2014 marked the introduction of EMP Museum's partnership with Decibel and made the poster festival a part of the Opening Gala in the Skychurch.

Email is often overlooked, but when approached at a person-to-person scale, it can be a powerful and honest driving force to inspire being a part of a poster show full of your friends. All it takes is a Google Form, a spreadsheet, Mailchimp's merge tags, a heavy dose of heartfelt honesty and you're just a pushpin supply away from an artshow.
