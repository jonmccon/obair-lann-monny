When Vine launched there was no way to view the best videos and no means of pulling them into an interface outside of the app itself. I partnered with Angel Samano to not only take a crack at scraping the Twitter API but make it into its own game. That team at Vine has since built, and shuttered, their first party API for exploring content.

Under the direction of Tether Labs & lots of 16-bit illustrations later, we had a working prototype for the collection, voting, ranking and sharing of the best Vines. Sometimes the best work never sees the light of the public, but sometimes it's worth the trouble to give life to new tools.
