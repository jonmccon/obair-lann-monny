## In the North, near an arboretum strewn with brick, was a small tower dedicated to learning the craft of applied design thinking. Problem was, no one ventured up there much.

I was able to pull together an extra graduating show, planned with a handful of students, in Seattle's Pioneer Square at the Tether Gallery. Single projects from 16 seniors, packed house, ridiculous guest book, what's better?

Design and production in collaboration with Riley Hoonan, Glenn Newcomer, photography from Erik Simkins. Special thanks to Daniel Petrzelka & Bebet Caguin of Tether and the WWU Class of 2010.
