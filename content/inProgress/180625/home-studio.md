## ivar

the ivar desk / workstation is a funny functionality driven decision. It's fun, it feels like I can focus a bit more than my previous workspaces. I'm figuring out the home office balance again. What times are best for what work. What times are best for dog walks and dinners and hammocks. And what times are just good for getting out of the house. But the desk feels like a level up though it's not fully functional- the stereo is mostly set and cables ran, the speakers findng a home with a little ivar bracket. and ivar cable ties. and ivar wall mounts. may I present to you my new favorite corner of the internet: [the ivar aisle of Printables](https://www.printables.com/search/models?ctx=models&q=ivar)

## Feels

Felt wall is put together, about 9 tiles of the 15 that were available in the Langley studio. I don't know if I really needed them all, so it feels like enough space to effectively use. Nothing will rot up on the wall for too long. Stil need to figure out my lighting scenario, I have the wyze bulbs and a wall to light, and post to attach them to. Again not the ideal natural light scenario- but it's a working one and that's what I'm focused on right now.
