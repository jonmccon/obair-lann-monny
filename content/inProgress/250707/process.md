<!-- ## Calendaring -->

I was waching one of Dan Catt's weeknotes on timing and planning and his calendaring practice. And lo and behold I just lived it. Here I've been trying to establish a practice for myself. Something that respects how I want to work and how I actually work (which do not always complement each other). 

Summer schedule starts popping into everyone's brains and I get invited to be in a show that I have no work prepared for. My brain goes into overdrive to figure out how to prepare enough to be in this. I go off the rails. Finally I decide that instead of pushing myself to the limit again to make this external yet self imposed deadline- I'm not going to be in the show. I'm going to work at my pace. Literally the next month, I am shown another show that I could be in and literally my brain goes into overdrive of how to basically start/develop/print an entirely new piece in about three weeks. Which, frankly, is what I did accomplish in April for the last show. It went off well, the narrow result was good. 

The overall sprint and pass out method is what I learned. That that's jsut the way this is supposed to work. I want to reject that part of my brain. Maybe in school where I learned this method it was needed to survive, but I am conciously deciding to reject this part of my brain. So- I'm not going to sprint again this month to meet the next self imposed external deadline. And I'm saying this having spent an hour planning out how I was going to achieve it.  

Cheers to listening to your gut, taking a breath, taking a step back. I picked up this mindset at somepoint that if I wasn't moving forward at 110% then I wasn't doing anything. slowerness is not negative. The whole "if you're not first, you're last" mentality is bullshit. 

I digress. I seek my own timeline. For up to this point I've been unable to find the gravity in listening to my own. This in an effort for my health and for those near me. 

So what does that schedule look like-
