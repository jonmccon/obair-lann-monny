<!-- ## how do i run a store  -->

i think separation of interests makes a lot of sense for most people. so now that i am the creator, printer, and now _in process_ of being the proprietor of a shop- i really get it. I love it. but I really understand how being good at any one of these is a more sound strategy. 

speaking of strategy how do i even determine what goes on the shelves? testing variations, comparative shopping, single one offs... my strategy evolved has evolved from multiple start and stops and now it's this: if I made it, I will sell it. some will be better than others, some will be more complex or available in production runs, some will be printed on demand because its easier to keep the artwork available than to make and categorize and find the storage for X quantity. 

this new strategy also works for my brain a bit better. it's faster, it's cleaner, it's more honest and frankly it's more fun. it's less precious, which may be the thing that's been holding me back.
