## Rebuilding

For every workspace I've now built and rebuilt I find I lack the same discipline in my digital tooling. I'm working at getting better at this by understanding my own work patterns and then repeating that in each new effort. 

Instead of every new plotter piece being a progression of what I learned before and tossing out however I implemented it before. vpype is the utility that is pushing me to approach my work more systemically. but really it started with the intech midi controller. first i had to figure out how to even get it setup, but then being able to quickly pull those parts out into a more universally recognized utility for any of my sketches. I can just reference it and swap in the variables and I have that immediate physical manipulation of a sketch. 

is this being a proper engineer? 

I'll perhaps not know. But it works for me. I can tell i'm getting better and am able to better previsualize my approach to a problem. similar to a design muscle, but just in a different / new context. 

I also have been facing this issue of physicality. Where I've moved about 5 or six times in the last 3 years. So while I'm nailing processes down, I'm also learning to filter down what I need. No longer do I have the ability to simply filla storage unit with every tool, paper, neat object, or idea that I've ever had. Editing, focusing, rebuilding my phsyical working space multiple times until I not only can relax from not having to pack it up again but that it's enough to work with. nailing processes but also trying to fnd the tool that I used / printed / developed for the process. is it here? is it in storage? what box? when did I last use it? 

two sides to this process of art making and creative work. the creative part and the work part. one foot in front of the other.
